# Credit Card Form Validation

## Description

This project is a React-based credit card form that includes validation for various fields such as the cardholder's name, card number, expiration date, and CVC. It uses styled-components for styling and React hooks for managing state and handling form submission. The form displays error messages for invalid inputs and shows a success message upon successful submission.

## Features

- Real-time form validation for credit card details using react-hook-form and YUP.
- Display of formatted credit card number and expiration date.
- Error messages for invalid inputs.
- Success message upon successful form submission.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views.

## Technologies Used

- React
- `react hook-form`
- YUP
- styled-components


## What I Learned

- **Form Validation: Implemented complex real-time validation for various form fields using react-hook-form and YUP, enhancing the user experience by displaying appropriate error messages.
- **Input Formatting:** Gained experience in formatting input fields, such as adding spaces in the credit card number and limiting input length.
- **State Management:** Enhanced my understanding of managing form state using React hooks like useState and integrating them with react-hook-form.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Practiced conditional rendering to display error messages and switch between the form view and the success message.

## Future Improvements

- Needs better expiration date validations to ensure they accurately reflect real-world credit card expiration rules.
